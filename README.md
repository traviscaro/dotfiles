# Dotfiles

This repo contains the configurations I use for my various system configurations.

## Getting Started

This repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink dotfiles to their appropriate locations. 

Without custom overrides, this repo expects to live in `$HOME/.dotfiles` [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
